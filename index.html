        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In India, the incidence of cancer is increasing rapidly, therefore it is important to step up cancer literacy and knowledge amongst the population.</p>
        <p>We hope that this will lead to early detection which is important in the management and treatment of cancer and also prevention by making necessary changes in lifestyle.</p>

        <h2>Common Types of Cancer</h2>
        <p>Breast Cancer is rapidly rising amongst women in urban areas and it is the most common cancer in India. Early detection is essential in its management and treatment. Due to ignorance, fear, and social stigma many women present with stage III or IV cancer which requires surgery and extensive treatment. If detected early, then in most cases there will be less aggressive treatment and better chances of recovery.</p>
        <p><b>Cervical Cancer:</b> This is the second most common cancer among women in India. It is the only preventable cancer and can be detected in the pre-cancerous phase and cured.</p>
        <p><b>Oral and Lung Cancers:</b> These are highest among men and women in both urban and rural populations and can also be prevented to a large extent. Therefore, making people aware of the dangers of chewing tobacco and smoking is of great importance.</p>
